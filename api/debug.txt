This is probably why I\u2019ve always been more keen on \u201cdifferent\u201d, well designed or story-driven games than shooters like _Call of Duty_.\n\nBut I think Video Games need and benefit from criticism. Every other form of media is subject to it. After all, other people\u2019s opinion is how you realise that you\u2019ve done something wrong. How you improve the next time. The last two months have been a nightmare for video games, and this is an understatement.\n\nTwo persons that I admire, that I look up to, have been chased from their homes by death and rape threats. [Brianna Wu][1] for trying to reach out to the \u201cleaders\u201d of GamerGate and [retweeting][2] a [meme][3]. [Anita Sarkeesian][4] for [advocating gender equality][5] in games. Three conferences where she was scheduled to speak received bomb threats. She had to cancel a talk at Utah State University because [someone promised a mass shooting][6] otherwise. Women have been bullied and harassed to the point some of them [left][7] [the industry][8] altogether.\n\nThis cannot go on. Even though they\u2019re trying to mask their cause as a \u201cconcern for ethics in video games journalism\u201d, [GamerGate started as a harassment campaign][9] on developer Zoe Quinn, and did not change since. This movement is nothing but a disgusting war on women in video games. They threaten, insult and harass anyone who opposes to them, hunting down people they call *Social Justice Warriors*[^1].\n\nGamerGate needs to stop now. It has never been about ethics, and will never be. If someone is destroying video games right now it\u2019s them, not the people asking for more diversity.\n\n\n[1]: https://twitter.com/spacekatgal\n[2]: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/brianna-wu-gamergate-human-cost\n[3]: http://5by5.tv/isometric/24\n[4]: https://twitter.com/femfreq\n[5]: http://www.feministfrequency.com\n[6]: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/anita-sarkeesian-gamergate-interview-20141017?page=4\n[7]: http://www.themarysue.com/gamergate-harms-women/\n[8]: http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/09/05/youll-never-guess-what-misogynistic-gamebros-did-to-these-two-women-in-gaming-hint-drove-them-out/\n[9]: https://storify.com/EffNOVideoGames/stopgamergate-it-has-always-been-a-spin\n\n[^1]: I still don\u2019t understand how someone can think their cause is legitimate when they consider advocating for equality and diversity an insult","tags":"feminism, video games","time":1414151112,"title":"Gamergate has to stop"}'
